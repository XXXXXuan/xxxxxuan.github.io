Exciting update â€” my Rednote (Xiaohongshu) account has just passed **100 followers**! Unlike many platforms, Rednote is accessible worldwide, allowing researchers and bloggers from different regions to share and engage with each other. 

- One of my posts, where I explained how I integrate **AlphaFold3** into my research paper, reached **2700+ views**, **27 comments** and **410 favorites/bookmarks**. 
- Another post announcing the acceptance of my article in *<i>New Phytologist</i>* has already gained **5,900+ views**, **65 comments**, and **270 favorites/bookmarks**.

I'm thrilled to see this level of interest and interaction.  

Feel free to follow me on Rednote: **@bioXyc**
