excerpt: 'Plant mineral nutrition is essential for crop yields and human health. However, the uneven distribution of mineral elements over time and space leads to a lack or excess of available mineral elements in plants. Among the essential nutrients, calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) stands out as a prominent second messenger that plays crucial roles in response to extracellular stimuli in all eukaryotes. Distinct Ca<sup>2+</sup> signatures with unique parameters are induced by different stresses and deciphered by various Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors. Recent research on the participation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in regulation of mineral elements has made great progress. In this review, we focus on the impact of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling on plant mineral uptake and detoxification. Specifically, we emphasize the significance of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling for regulation of plant mineral nutrition and delve into key points and novel avenues for future investigations, aiming to offer new insights into plant ion homeostasis.'
