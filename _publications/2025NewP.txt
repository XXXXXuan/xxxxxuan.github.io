excerpt: 'Sulfur (S) is a crucial macronutrient for plant growth, development, and stress tolerance. It serves as an essential component of amino acids (cysteine and methionine), vitamins, sulfatides, and coenzymes. S deficiency impairs plant productivity; yet, the molecular mechanisms regulating sulfate uptake remain poorly understood.
In this study, brassinosteroid (BR) signaling was found to be activated under S deficiency, leading to the nuclear accumulation of BZR1, a central transcription factor in the BR signaling. BZR1 expression increased at both the mRNA and protein levels under S deficiency conditions.
<i>SULTR1;2</i>, a high-affinity sulfate transporter, was identified as a direct downstream target of BZR1 through <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> analyses. Genetic and physiological evidence demonstrated that BZR1 promotes sulfate uptake via <i>SULTR1;2</i> in a BR-dependent manner.
These findings uncover a molecular mechanism by which BR signaling regulates the S deficiency response through BZR1-mediated activation of <i>SULTR1;2</i>. This work enhances our understanding of nutrient signaling in Arabidopsis and provides potential targets for improving S use efficiency in crops.'
